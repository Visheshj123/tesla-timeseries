# tesla-timeseries
This project used Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to model Tesla stock price over a period of four years.

The purpose of this project was to better understand the capabilities and limitiations of ARIMA. According to this project, ARIMA does a phenomonal job at modeling univariate time series provided that the data can be stationarized via differencing. 

The model used 1-step forecasting and was evaluated using MSE and graphical visualization between the time series data and the model predictions. Furthermore, I compared the autocorrelation between them to further verify the model's ability to capture the linear dependence present in the data.
